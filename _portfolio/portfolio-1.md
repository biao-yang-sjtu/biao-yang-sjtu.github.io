**Abstract**  
A central debate in climate finance concerns whether greener firms earn higher returns. While theory predicts lower expected returns for green stocks, empirical evidence based on realized returns shows the opposite. I reconcile this divergence by developing a climate-integrated production-based asset pricing model that quantitatively explains both expected and realized return differences between green and brown firms. The model incorporates long-run productivity risk and green consumption preferences, and generates two novel mechanisms: (i) green stocks are less exposed to long-run risk, leading to lower expected returns; (ii) positive shocks to green consumption preferences increase green demand, raising realized green returns. Calibrated to U.S. data, the model matches key macro-financial and climate moments, and replicates the dynamics of greenâ€“brown returns and investments. Overall, it provides a unified framework linking climate finance with production-based asset pricing."
